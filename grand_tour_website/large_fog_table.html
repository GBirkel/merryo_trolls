<P>An array of 32768 16-bit values takes up 64k of space.  By today's standards, that's absolutely nothing.  By 1992 standards, that's a significant amount - especially since software shipped on 3.5-inch magnetic disks that only held 800k each.  (Yes, that means you can store more than five thousand of those disks, uncompressed, on one single-sided blank DVD.)</P>

<P>Disk storage was the real problem here - 64k out of 800k leaves that much less room for artwork, maps, sound effects, and other data that could be part of Super Merryo Trolls.  Instead of storing the whole 64k fog-array on the disk, it made sense to calculate it dynamically.  The following code uses the 8-bit fog-array as reference, and generates the 16-bit fog array with a pair of loops.  Instead of taking 64k on disk, it claims less than 1k.
</P>

<P>If you're not familiar with Apple IIgs Assembly Language, the "SEP" and "REP" instructions may confuse you.  Those are the opcodes that change the size of the A, X, and Y registers.  They're used to set and clear single-bit-sized flags inside the CPU: The "SEP" opcode sets bits, and the "REP" opcode clears them.  For example "SEP #$20" sets the flag for the A register - making the register 8 bits wide.  "REP #$10" clears the flag controlling the X and Y registers, making them both 16 bits wide.  And of course, "REP #$30" would clear both flags, making A, X, and Y all 16 bits wide.</P>

<P>The other thing that may confuse you is the "XBA" opcode.  That merely swaps the low and high bytes of the A register.</P>
