<P>
Why make a color table by hand when you can tell the computer to make one for you?
</P>

<div class="centering"><div><img src="fog-array.png" /></div></div>

<P>
This table was generated by running this tiny thing called FOGTABLE.BAS:

<PRE class="codeonly">
 5  DIM R(17):F = 12288
 10  FOR G = 1 TO 16: READ R(G): NEXT
     G
 20  FOR Y = 0 TO 15: FOR X = 0 TO
     15: POKE F + X + (Y * 16),R(
     X + 1) + (R(Y + 1) * 16): NEXT
     X: NEXT Y

<P>The assembled array was written into memory location 12288, and we issued a PRODOS command to save it to disk from there.</P>
